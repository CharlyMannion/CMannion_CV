## About Me

I am a full stack developer and Associate Product Developer at AND Digital. After completing a History degree, I worked as a Finance Technology Consultant at EY and RBS before deciding to pursue a career as a developer. I completed the Northcoders Coding Bootcamp, where I worked as a tutor before moving to AND. I am a flexible thinker, a keen learner, and I have a curiosity for both people and tech. I am drawn to coding as I find the problem-solving and collaborative working style to be fun, rewarding and satisfying.

## Skills

#### Teamwork
Our final project team at Northcoders... But by ensuring my team stuck to daily stand ups, check-ins and retros, I ensured the team remained cohesive, focused on our objectives. This ensured that there was room for fun. The most important skill I learned during this week was how to work well in a dev team. 

#### Fast Learner

In my previous job at RBS, I joined a team initially consisting of only two people, on a Project where I was considered an SME for Ringtail E-Discovery software. I had never used this software before and did not have a technical background. But through research and writing how-to guides as I learnt, I was able to quickly solidify my understanding. This also meant I was soon able to teach other people on the project how to use the software.
